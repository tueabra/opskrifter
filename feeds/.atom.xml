&lt;p&gt;Heat peanut oil in a wok or heavy based skillet/fry pan over medium heat. Add eggs and cook until scrambled, then remove onto plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase heat to high and add chopped bacon, excess fat trimmed. Cook until golden, then remove onto plate with egg - about 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drain off excess bacon fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add remaining peanut oil, minced garlic and ginger. Return wok to stove on high heat. Stir fry as it comes up to heat, donâ€™t let it burn. When garlic starts to sizzle, add finally chopped onion and stir fry for 2 minutes until golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add Chinese cooking wine and sugar and let it simmer rapidly, stirring, for 20 seconds, until mostly evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add prawns and stir fry for 1 minute to heat through if pre-cooked, cook longer to cook if raw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add refrigerated overnight cooked rice, Sauce, eggs, bacon and thinly sliced scallions. Stir fry for 2 minutes until rice is hot - around 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to serving plate, sprinkle with thinly sliced scallions and serve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Aftensmad"></category><category term="vegetar"></category></entry><entry><title>olivier salad</title><link href="opskrifter/olivier-salad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-13T13:17:25+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-13T13:17:25+01:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2022-02-13:opskrifter/olivier-salad.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;olivier salad&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Zero step is cook corn beef. Put into a large pan and simmer for 2%hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to cook your potatoes and carrots. I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam the potatoes for 30%minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs. Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chop pickles finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finelly chopped dill. This is a Russian salad, after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Aftensmad"></category></entry><entry><title>Nemme pandekager</title><link href="opskrifter/nemme-pandekager.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-13T13:17:25+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-13T13:17:25+01:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2022-02-13:opskrifter/nemme-pandekager.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nogle nemme pandekager, som selv jeg kan lave&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crack the eggs into a blender, then add the flour, milk and sea salt, and blitz until smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour into a bowl and leave to stand for 15%minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melt the butter (or a drizzle of oil if you want to be a bit healthier) in a large non-stick frying pan{} on a medium heat, then tilt the pan so the butter coats the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour in 1 ladle of batter and tilt again, so that the batter spreads all over the base, then cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it starts to come away from the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once golden underneath, flip the pancake over and cook for 1 further minute, or until cooked through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve straightaway with your favourite topping.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Desert"></category><category term="pandekage"></category><category term="vegetar"></category></entry></feed>
